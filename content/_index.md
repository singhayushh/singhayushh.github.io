# Hey,

I'm Ayush, though I also go by the alias **Arc**. This site is my late-night retreat, a place to unwind and share my thoughts and passions under the starry night sky after a long day of work.

Here, you'll stumble upon a mix of writings. Sometimes, it's about my feelings, other times, it's tales of myths, histories, and the amazing things that captivate my thoughts. Feel free to join me on this quiet late-night journey. Each post is like a story of my interests, and together, we'll explore the wonders that come alive in my head at night.

### What do I do?

Professionally, I am actively engaged in software development and system architecture, working on a variety of projects ranging from web applications to API development to microservices. I am currently working for [Mind Webs Ventures](https://mindwebs.org/), where I actively shape and lead various software development initiatives. 

Though I'll almost never be writing about my career and work life, I've created a separate page for those interested in my professional background, which you can find [here](/about/career).
