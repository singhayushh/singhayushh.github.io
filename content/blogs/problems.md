# Problems

```...and me```

This post isn't about me ranting about the many problems I have in my life. This is just about my outlook on facing problems, or you may even say - a way of life in itself.


## okay, 
What I see everywhere and really get mad about, is that people are always trying so much to avoid problems. Always living in this precautious state of mind, that the essence of being is totally lost.

*Wow Ayush, so outrageous and stupid ye?*
It's just my take, I know how it is going to sound and that's also why I never share these controversial thoughts with anyone -_-

## hm.

What I want to say is, people spend so much time and energy in choosing what to do, what to say, whether to go by their intuition, whether to approach some xyz person, whether to ask some question, in short - whether to jump, that the excitement and significance of that thing you wanted to do, words you wanted to say, intuitive thoughts you wanted to go by - making the jump - is all lost to a great extent. 

Sabse bura kya hi hoga, you will fall. You'll either break your bones or your heart. You'll face rejection or you'll be humbled down. But all these, are also emotions right? Emotions are what makes life worth living. Why would you run from them, specially when they get dark.

It's okay to spend a week in the hostpital. It's okay to crumble in a corner in your bed and cry. It's okay to feel anger, anxiety, frustation, helplessness. It's okay to feel. That's what makes you a human.

## aight,

Try to understand, I am not saying you to stop overthinking or to stop thinking about all the scenarios about something. I do that myself all the time. I am trying to say that just because there is a possibility of failure or things turning problematic, don't back away from doing something. Embrace problems as much as happiness. Go for it.

bye.
